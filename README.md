# Galaxy Buds — Omarchy plugin

![The Galaxy Buds panel](preview.png)

Noise control for Samsung Galaxy Buds in the Omarchy bar. Click the ear icon to
switch noise modes, see the battery of each earbud as a bar, and toggle
**360 Audio**, **touch controls** and **quick connect**.

The icon follows the earbuds, not the other way around: change the mode by
touching an earbud or from your phone and the bar updates immediately.

Controls the model does not have are hidden rather than shown dead — a Buds+
has no ANC and no 360 Audio, so it gets an ambient-sound switch and nothing
about spatial audio.

It also picks the **Bluetooth codec** (the A2DP profiles PipeWire offers for
that card), shows a bolt on whatever is charging, and — when two pairs are
connected at once — controls the pair sound is actually going to, saying so
when the pair on screen is not the audio output.

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4 (the Quickshell-based `omarchy-shell`)
- A pair of Galaxy Buds already paired in Bluetooth
- The system Python at `/usr/bin/python3` with `dbus-python` and `PyGObject`
  (`python-dbus` and `python-gobject` on Arch — both are already present on a
  stock Omarchy install)
- PipeWire with `pactl`, for the codec row only; without it every other feature
  still works

No other packages, no daemon to install, and nothing that asks for root:
it runs entirely as your own user.

## Install

Review the repository, then add the plugin:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/aislandener/galaxy-buds-control.git
```

Accept the prompt to enable the plugin during installation.

For an unattended install from a repository you already trust:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/aislandener/galaxy-buds-control.git --enable --yes
```

The widget lands in the right bar section. Put it next to the audio panel with:

```bash
omarchy bar move aislandener.galaxy-buds --before omarchy.audio
```

Nothing else to configure — the model is detected from the Bluetooth device id
or, on older models, from its name.

## Update

Review and apply the next fast-forward update:

```bash
omarchy plugin update aislandener.galaxy-buds
```

Or update all Git-managed plugins:

```bash
omarchy plugin update --all
```

## Uninstall

```bash
omarchy plugin remove aislandener.galaxy-buds
```

Removing the plugin stops its helper and leaves nothing behind: it writes no
files of its own, and the earbuds keep whatever mode they were last set to.

## Keybinds

The plugin answers on its own IPC target, so a Hyprland bind can drive it
without opening the popover:

```
bind = SUPER SHIFT, A, exec, omarchy-shell aislandener.galaxy-buds cycle
bind = SUPER SHIFT, N, exec, omarchy-shell aislandener.galaxy-buds set anc
```

`cycle`, `set <off|anc|ambient>`, `open`, `close`, `toggle` and `status` are
available. Never call `bin/galaxy-buds` directly for this — see below.

## What it does on your system

Everything this plugin does, in full:

- **Bluetooth**: registers an `org.bluez.Profile1` client on the system D-Bus
  and opens one RFCOMM socket to the earbuds, to read their state and send the
  commands the panel offers. It talks to no other device.
- **Commands it runs**: `/usr/bin/python3` (its own helper, from this
  repository) and `pactl` (to list cards and sinks, and to set a card profile
  when you pick a codec).
- **Privileges**: none beyond your own user. It never elevates.
- **Files**: none. It writes nothing and reads nothing outside its own
  repository.
- **Network**: none.
- **Background**: one helper process, started and stopped with the shell.
- **IPC**: registers the `aislandener.galaxy-buds` shell IPC target with
  `open`, `close`, `toggle`, `cycle`, `set <mode>`, `codec <profile>` and
  `status`. Keybindings are yours to define; the plugin adds none.
- **User configuration**: none required. Optional label overrides live in your
  own `shell.json` entry, and the plugin never writes to it.

## Security

This plugin runs unsandboxed inside `omarchy-shell` when enabled. Review its
source and the behavior documented above before installing it.

## How it works

`bin/galaxy-buds` speaks Samsung's SPP protocol over an RFCOMM socket that
BlueZ hands over through the Profile1 API — the same path GalaxyBudsClient
takes on Linux. It prints the earbud state as JSON lines and takes commands as
JSON lines on stdin.

The plugin runs it from `Service.qml`, which the shell mounts once per session,
and every bar reads that one object. Bar widgets are mounted once per monitor,
so owning the process in the widget would start one helper per screen.

**Only one program can hold that connection.** Opening the GalaxyBudsClient GUI
while the widget is running will take the link away from one of the two, and
running a second copy of the helper by hand does the same. Drive the plugin
through its IPC target instead.

Uses the system Python (`/usr/bin/python3`) for `dbus-python` and `PyGObject`.
No extra packages, no daemon to install, no root.

## Translating the labels

Every visible string is English by default and can be replaced from this
widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "aislandener.galaxy-buds",
  "labels": {
    "noiseControl": "Controle de ruído",
    "settings": "Ajustes",
    "off": "Desligado",
    "ambient": "Som ambiente",
    "spatial": "Áudio 360",
    "touch": "Controles de toque",
    "seamless": "Conexão rápida",
    "case": "Estojo",
    "disconnected": "Desconectado. Tire os fones do estojo para reconectar."
  }
}
```

Every key is optional; anything you leave out keeps its English text.

| Key | Default |
|---|---|
| `noiseControl` | Noise control |
| `settings` | Settings |
| `off` / `anc` / `ambient` / `adaptive` | Off / ANC / Ambient / Adaptive |
| `codec` | Codec |
| `spatial` | 360 Audio |
| `touch` | Touch controls |
| `seamless` | Quick connect |
| `left` / `right` / `case` | L / R / Case |
| `notOutput` | Not the audio output |
| `disconnected` | Disconnected. Take them out of the case to reconnect. |
| `notPaired` | No Galaxy Buds paired. |
| `serviceOff` | The plugin service is not running. |

## Models

| Model | Noise control | 360 Audio | Touch | Quick connect | Charging |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Buds (original) | ambient on/off | — | yes | — | — |
| Buds+ | ambient on/off | — | yes | firmware 11+ | — |
| Buds Live | ANC on/off | firmware 9+ | yes | yes | — |
| Buds Pro | off / ANC / ambient | firmware 2+ | yes | yes | — |
| Buds2, Buds2 Pro, Buds FE, Buds Core | off / ANC / ambient | most | yes | yes | yes |
| Buds3, Buds3 Pro, Buds3 FE | off / ANC / ambient | most | yes | yes | yes |

Battery is reported by every model; the case only reports its own charge while
the earbuds are sitting in it, so that bar comes and goes. Which earbud is
charging is only reported from Buds2 on — on older models that byte means
something else, so no bolt is shown rather than a guessed one.

### Codec

The codec row comes from PipeWire, not from the earbuds, so it works the same
on every model. If you already run the `bt.codecs` plugin, this replaces it.

**Auto** is PipeWire's generic A2DP profile: it negotiates the best codec both
ends support, which is usually what you want. Because the profile name says
nothing about what it picked, the section header shows the codec actually in
use — `Codec · AAC` — read from the sink rather than the profile. The other
buttons pin a specific codec instead.

A codec only appears when both the earbuds and PipeWire offer it. AAC needs
`libfdk-aac` installed; a pair that never negotiates AAC will not list it.

**While something holds the microphone** — a call in Discord, say — PipeWire
switches the card to a headset profile, where the music codecs are not choices
at all. The row follows that: it offers the call codecs (mSBC, CVSD) and the
header marks the mode with a mic glyph, so the music codecs going away reads as
"you are on a call" rather than "they disappeared". PipeWire switches back on
its own when the microphone is released.

Tested on **Galaxy Buds2 Pro** and **Galaxy Buds+**. The rest come from the
protocol layout and have not been exercised on real hardware.

What differs per model lives in the `PROFILES` table in `bin/galaxy-buds`:
which service UUID to connect on (each generation uses a different one), which
command changes the noise mode, where each field sits in the status message,
and which firmware revision started reporting it. Adding a model is a row.

A model the table does not know still gets noise control and battery — those
bytes have not moved since Buds Live — and hides 360 Audio rather than reading
a byte that means something else on that firmware.

## Validate from source

```bash
omarchy plugin validate .
```

## Tests

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 tests/test_protocol.py
```

Framing, CRC, per-model status parsing, command encoding, codec discovery and
device selection — all without earbuds.
